This project is a console application to test the amount of time it takes to post and retrieve messages from a local MSMQ queue.  It assumes that you have MSMQ installed and enabled and that you have created a local public queue called "testq," though the queue name and MSMQ location can be easily altered through  configuration.

To use the application, compile it and run the executable, or run it with debugging through Visual Studio.

Once running, type "/help" or "/h" for a list of commands and settings that can be used to test your queue.
